                    Changing my career into the field of tech is one of the most rewarding and challenging decisions. I absolutely love solving problems and fixing bugs. I enjoyed working in the back-end building RESTful APIs, modeling databases, and connecting servers in class. React has been a dream to build with and I'm working on Redux. I revel in the complexity it takes to build an app from the ground up. To watch it grow from an idea, a wireframe, a mock-up, pages, components, states, forms, databases, and queries to a polished product. It's appealing to continously work with new technologies and features and it fuels me into improving existing and starting new projects in my free time.

                    Iâ€™ve worn many
                    hats in my life which have given me the life lessons and experiences to mold
                    me into a very adaptable and hard-working individual. Spending most of my
                    working life in the hospitality industry, I know what is to be punctual,
                    energizing, polite, calm, a multitasker and flexible. My work in the outdoor
                    industry has given me the title of teacher, leader, steward, athlete,
                    competitor, and risk manager. The volunteering work I do has taught me how
                    to be an influencer with integrity, an enthusiastic motivator, and an organized
                    and dependable communicator. All of these traits have made my transition
                    into a web developer much smoother. The daily collaboration is a crucial part
                    of the experience. I can't wait to build some amazing things together.</main></Col>
